# 🏗 Overview

The Hiring Application is a distributed backend system that allows:

- User registration and authentication
- Job category management
- Job creation and search
- Advert posting
- Offer submission
- Notification handling
- File upload and download

The system follows modern backend engineering standards suitable for large-scale applications.

# 🏛 Architecture

Client  
→ API Gateway  
→ Microservices  
→ PostgreSQL  
→ Kafka  
→ Redis  
→ Monitoring Stack  

## Core Components

- Config Server – Centralized configuration management
- Eureka Server – Service discovery
- API Gateway – Routing & request filtering
- Auth Service – JWT authentication & authorization
- User Service – User management
- Job Service – Categories, Jobs, Adverts, Offers
- Notification Service – Event-driven notifications
- File Storage Service – File handling
- Redis – Caching layer
- Kafka – Asynchronous messaging
- Prometheus – Metrics collection
- Grafana – Monitoring dashboards

---

#  Engineering Features

## 1️⃣ Circuit Breaker & Retry

- Prevents cascading failures
- Provides fallback mechanisms
- Configurable retry strategy
- Applied to inter-service communication

Improves system reliability and fault tolerance.

---

## 2️⃣ Outbox Pattern

Solves the dual-write problem in distributed systems.

Implementation:

- Domain entity + event saved in same DB transaction
- Event stored in `outbox` table
- Background scheduler publishes event to Kafka
- Event marked as processed after successful publish

Ensures:
- No message loss
- Eventual consistency
- Reliable event delivery

---

## 3️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture

Kafka events published for:

- Advert Created
- Offer Created
- Job Updated

Notification Service consumes events asynchronously.

Benefits:

- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Failure isolation
- Improved responsiveness

---

## 4️⃣ Redis Caching Strategy

Implements Cache-Aside Pattern.

Cached Endpoints:

- Get all jobs
- Get categories
- Job search queries

Features:

- TTL-based eviction
- Cache invalidation on updates
- Reduced DB load
- Faster read operations

---

## 5️⃣ Monitoring & Observability

Integrated with:

- Spring Boot Actuator
- Prometheus
- Grafana

Monitored Metrics:

- Request count
- Error rate
- Latency
- JVM memory usage
- Service health

Provides production-level visibility into system behavior.

---

## 6️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline

Pipeline Steps:

1. Checkout code
2. Build project
3. Run unit tests
4. Build Docker image
5. Push to Docker registry

Triggers on:
- Pull Requests
- Push to main branch
